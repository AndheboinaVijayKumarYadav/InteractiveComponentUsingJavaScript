# what I have learned
structuring the html and using appropiate tags for example
#1 instead of using five div's elements for rating list I would have use unordered list ul 
<ul> 
    <li>1</li>
    <li>2</li>
    <li>3</li>
    <li>4</li>
    <li>5</li>
</ul>
#2 Proper naming of the elements like id ,class etc
#3 in CSS I have how to use custom properties effectively , to reduce code by using child selectors exp
.component > * {} selector . 
#4 Proper utilization of flex box concept 
#5 use of media queries 
coming to Javascript
#6 to properyly select the dom elements using querySelector and querySelectorAll
